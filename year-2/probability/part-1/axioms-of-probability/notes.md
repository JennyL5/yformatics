## Sample space & events

Following on from our counting methodology of thinking about experiments and outcomes, we now turn to looking at this in a broader context. For each experiment performed, we can collect all of the possible outcomes in a set that we call the 'sample space'.

$$S = \\{ \text{all possible outcomes} \\}$$

Any subset of this total is known as an 'event'.

$$E \subset S$$

For example, lets look at rolling a fair die. The die being 'fair' means that the probabilities of all outcomes in the sample space are equal. The sample space is the set of numbers 1 to 6.

$$S = \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}$$

Suppose we want to focus on the event that the result is an even number. The sets our event as:

$$E = \\{2,4,6\\}$$

## Union & intersection

When looking at events we can also look at multiple events at once. Continuing with our example of a fair die, consider the two events that the result is an even number and the result is a prime number.

$$E_1 = \\{2,4,6\\}$$

$$E_2 = \\{2,3,5\\}$$

The union of these two events is the combination of all the elements of both of the sets together. In this case, all results that are even or prime.

$$E_1 \cup E_2 = \\{2,3,4,5,6\\}$$

The intersection of these two events is the set that contains the elements that appear in both events. In this case, all results that are even and prime.

$$E_1 \cap E_2 = \\{2\\}$$

You also need to know the composite of an event. This is the rest of the sample space minus that event. It has either of the below notations:

$$E^c$$

$$S \backslash E$$

For the event that the result is an even number then:

$$E = \\{2,4,6\\}$$

$$E^c = \\{1,3,5\\}$$
