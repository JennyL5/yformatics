## Binary search trees

The official definition of a binary tree is that it is either empty or has a root vertex with a left and/or a right child, each of which is also a tree. This is a recursive datatype so the definition applies at any given vertex. These vertices fall into two types:

- Internal vertex <br>
  This type of vertex has one or two children where a choice can be made to travel to either.

- Leaf vertex <br>
  This type of vertex has no children and is the end of a given path.

An internal vertex with one or both children being leaves is called a near leaf vertex.
