## Electromotive force
When energy is being transferred from an external source like a battery to the circuit, the voltage is known as the electromotive force or emf. The emf is the maximum voltage a source can provide. This is the voltage across the cell when no current is drawn from it. You can measure it simply by connecting a voltmeter across its terminals when no other components are connected to it.

## Lost Volts
A cell has an internal resistance which means voltage is lost from its total emf when the cell is connected to a circuit. The ‘lost volts’ are not available to the components in the circuit.

$$V_{lost} = Ir$$

Where 'r' is the internal resistance of the cell.

## Terminal potential difference
As a result of ’lost volts’, the potential difference a cell is able to supply to components in a circuit is less than the emf. It is called the terminal potential difference, or tpd. This is the potential difference across the cell terminals when it is connected in a circuit.

$$V_{tpd} = IR$$

Where 'R' is the external resistance of the circuit.

## Short circuit
When the two terminals of a cell are connected together with a wire which has almost zero resistance, we say the cell has been short circuited.

$$E = Ir$$

'I' is known as the short circuit current which is the maximum current a cell can provide. All of the emf is now across the internal resistance. This can be very dangerous as the cell will heat up as electrical energy is converted into heat.

## Open circuit
When a cell is connected in a circuit but the circuit is incomplete, for example if a switch is open, we call this an open circuit. In this situation, because the voltage is zero, the tpd voltage across the terminals of the cell is equal to the emf.

$$E = V_{tpd}$$

## Internal resistance
It is possible to find the emf and internal resistance of a power supply using a circuit with a cell connected up with a variable resistor. The load resistance is altered using the variable resistor and the corresponding current and tpd values are recorded. If we rearrange the following formula into the form of a straight line equation then both the emf and internal resistance of the cell can be calculated:

<!--Insert circuit diagram-->

$$E = V + Ir$$

$$V = -r I + E$$

This can be plotted on a graph with the y-intercept as the emf and the gradient of the line as the negated internal resistance.
