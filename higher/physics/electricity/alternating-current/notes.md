## Revision
In a complete electric circuit containing a cell and a bulb, the free electrons in the conductor will experience a force. This causes them to drift away from the negative terminal towards the positive terminal of the cell. We know the electrons are charged and it is this flow of charge we describe as an electric current measured in amperes. Electric current is defined as the rate of flow of charge, leading to the following equation:

$$Q = It$$

Where:
- Q = Charge ($C$)
- I = Current ($A$)
- t = Time ($s$)

Electrons are negatively charged at a value of $e<sup>-</sup> = -1.6x10<sup>-19</sup>C.

Whilst the speed of electrical signals can travel through copper wires is extremely fast, almost the speed of light, the actual velocity of the individual electrons carrying this signal is quite slow. It varies widely but an average ‘drift velocity’ could be expected to be approximately 0.1mm s<sup>-1</sup>.

## AC & DC
So far in Physics, many of the circuits you will have looked at will have used a direct current supply from a simple cell or similar power source. While this is used in small batteries, the vast majority of electrical components are actually designed to be used with alternating current. AC is used everywhere in the real world from plugs in your house to the ceiling lights in your classroom.

## Current & Voltage
The differences between AC and DC don't just stop at the applications though. There are also major distinctions between the graphs showing voltage over time, where DC is simply a horizontal line, whereas AC displays a sine wave. This leads the two systems to have different peaks when supplying the same power to a given component. The DC voltage is known as the 'root mean square' voltage or V<sub>rms</sub> and the peak current is referred to as the 'root mean square' current or I<sub>rms</sub>.

<!--Insert AC/DC graph-->

The relationship between the root mean square voltage and the peak AC voltage and the root mean square current and the peak AC current are very similar and given by:

$$V\_{peak} = \sqrt{2} V\_{rms}$$

$$I\_{peak} = \sqrt{2} I\_{rms}$$

In the UK, the mains voltage is quoted as 230V. Although our mains supplies AC current, this is the V<sub>rms</sub> value. The mains voltage can actually rise to a peak of approximately 325V.

## Calculating peaks
The peak voltage and frequency of alternating current signals can be calculated by displaying the signal on an oscilloscope screen. The oscilloscope graphs the signal as potential difference against time.

Two of the main controls on a cathode ray oscilloscope are the Y-Gain and the timebase.

This can also allow you to calculate the peak AC voltage:

$$V_{peak} = peak \enspace height \times Y gain$$
