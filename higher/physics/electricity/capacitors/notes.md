## The component
Capacitors are very important components in electrical devices. They store electrical energy by allowing a charge distribution to accumulate on two conducting plates. A simple capacitor consists of two parallel metal plates separated by an electrical insulator such as air. The insulator is usually a dielectric material.

## Capacitance
Every capacitor has a maximum amount of charge it can store for a given potential difference. This depends largely on the material used to make the capacitor, the area of the metal plates and the thickness of the dielectric material. The capacitance is defined as the charge stored per volt across the capacitor:

$$C = \dfrac{Q}{V}$$

The unit of capacitance is the farad, F.

## Stored energy
When a capacitor is charging, electrons are being pushed on to the negatively charged plate. The battery must do work against the potential difference across the capacitor plates. This energy is then stored in the capacitor ready to be released when the capacitor is discharged.

The work done charging a capacitor can be calculated using the equation:

$$E = \dfrac{1}{2} Q V$$

This can also be rearranged into other forms using the capacitance equation:

$$E = \dfrac{1}{2} Q V = \dfrac{1}{2} C V^2 = \dfrac{1}{2} \dfrac{Q^2}{C}$$

## Charging and discharging
Graphs of potential difference against time and current against time can be generated for a capacitor charging and discharging. The shape depends on the value of the resistor connected in series with the capacitor as well as the value of the capacitor itself. The maximum potential difference reached across the capacitor is always equal to that of the supply voltage.

<!--Insert charging and discharging graphs-->

If the capacitor is allowed to finish charging, the final voltage or initial discharging voltage is equal to the supply voltage. The size of the initial charging or discharging current can be calculated, it depends on the value of the series resistor:

$$I = \dfrac{V_s}{R}$$

## Uses of capacitors
A camera flash requires a rapid release of energy which cannot be achieved from just a battery. A battery can be used to charge a capacitor, that can then provide the very high current needed.

Full Wave Rectification is when a number of capacitors are used to smooth a rectified d.c. signal.  A rectified d.c. signal is produced when four diodes connected as shown to the left to produce a d.c. output from an a.c. input.
