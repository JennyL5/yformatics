## Energy levels
So far we have met two main types of materials:
- Conductors <br>
  Materials that allow electrons to move - current can flow through them.
- Insulators <br>
  Materials that do not allow electrons to move - current cannot flow through them.

Electrons in atoms are arranged in energy shells where each shell can hold a certain number of electrons. If the outermost shell is full, the electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus. If the outermost shell is not full, the electrons are not tightly bound and are able to move away from the nucleus.

<!--## Conductors & insulators-->

## Bonding
The most commonly used semiconductors are silicon and germanium. Both these materials have a valency of four; they have four outer electrons available for bonding.

In a pure crystal, each atom is bonded covalently to another four atoms; all of its outer electrons are bonded and therefore there are few free electrons available to conduct. This makes the resistance very large. Such pure crystals are known as intrinsic semiconductors.

The few electrons that are available come from imperfections in the crystal lattice and thermal ionisation due to heating. A higher temperature will thus result in more free electrons, increasing the conductivity and decreasing the resistance, as in a thermistor.

## Doping
The electrical properties of semiconductors make them very important in electronic devices like transistors, diodes and light-dependent resistors (LDRs). In such devices, the electrical properties are dramatically changed by the addition of very small amounts of impurities. The process of adding impurities to these semiconductors is known as doping and once doped they are known as extrinsic semiconductors.

## p-n junctions
When a semiconductor is grown so that one half is p-type and the other half is n-type, the product is called a p–n junction which can function as a diode. At temperatures other than absolute zero, electrons from the n-type material diffuse across the boundary and recombine with holes from the p-type material, and vice versa. This recombination of holes and electrons results in a lack of majority charge carriers in the immediate vicinity of the junction creating a region known as the depletion layer.

## Diodes
When we apply an external voltage we say that the diode is biased. There are two types of bias:

- Forward biased <br>
  To make a diode conduct, a potential difference greater than 0.7 volts must be applied across the diode. The majority charge carriers (electrons in the n-type and holes in the p-type) can flow across the junction and round the circuit. Electrons flow from the n-type to the p-type.

- Reverse biased <br>
  This increases the width of the depletion layer forming an even greater barrier to the flow of charge carriers. The diode scarcely conducts. There is a very small current, known as the reverse or leakage current.

## Band structure
- n-type <br>
  In n-type, the added impurities introduce free electrons to the structure, which exist in an isolated energy level in the band gap called the donor level, near the conduction band. 

- p-type <br>
  In p-type, the added impurities introduce holes to the structure, which exist in an isolated energy level in the band gap called the acceptor level, near the valence band.

## Light emitting diodes
One example of the use of a p-n junction is in a LED. When electrons travel across the depletion region, they recombine with holes. The electrons then drop to a lower energy level, releasing a photon of energy. In some semiconductors such as gallium arsenide phosphide, this energy is emitted as light. If the junction is close to the surface of the material, this light is able to escape.

The recombination energy can be calculated if the frequency of the light emitted is measured. The energy is calculated using the formula:

$$E = hf$$

Like other diodes, the LED does not work in reverse bias since the charge carriers do not travel across the junction towards each other so cannot recombine.

## Photovoltaic cells
A p–n junction diode with a transparent coating will react to light in what is called the photoelectric effect. This type of diode is called a photodiode and is the basis for a solar cell.

Photodiodes can be used in a number of modes. Solar cells operate under what is called Photovoltaic mode. In this mode, the diode has no bias voltage applied.  Each individual photon that is incident on the junction has its energy absorbed producing electron-hole pairs. This results in an excess number of electrons in the n-type and an excess of holes in the p-type, producing a potential difference across the photodiode. 

Light has supplied energy to the circuit producing an emf that can be used to supply power. More intense light will lead to more electron-hole pairs being produced and therefore a higher voltage. The voltage is directly proportional to the light irradiance.
