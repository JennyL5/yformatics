## Potential Difference
Electric fields are areas where charges experience a force. Work has to be done when moving charges in an electric field.

> *"Potential difference or voltage is defined as the energy required to move one coulomb of charge between two points in the electric field."*

This can be seen in the equation:

<p>V = \dfrac{Ew}{Q}</p>

## Ohm’s law
At a constant temperature for a given resistor, we find that the current through the resistor is proportional to the voltage across it. The ratio of voltage to current is equal to a constant. This constant is known as resistance which is measured in ohms.

<p>V = IR</p>

Resistors are ohmic devices as they have a steady resistance. There are components which do not have a constant resistance as the current flowing through them is altered. These components are said to be non-ohmic, as their resistance changes with temperature.

## Electrical power
The power of a circuit component is how much electrical potential energy the component transforms (changes into other forms of energy) every second. The unit of power is the ‘watt’ (W) which is equivalent to a joule per second (Js<sup>-1</sup>). We can use Ohm's law to work out the equations to calculate power:

<p>P = \dfrac{E}{t}</p>

<p>P = IV</p>

<p>P = I^2R</p>

<p>P = \dfrac{V^2}{R}</p>

## Combining resistors
Resistors can be combined in series or in parallel. In any circuit, there may be multiple combinations of resistors in both series and parallel, any combination of resistors will have an effective total resistance.

To calculate the total resistance in a sereies circuit:

<p>R_T = R_1 + R_2 + ...</p>

To calculate the total resistance in a sereies circuit:

<p>\dfrac{1}{R_T} = \dfrac{1}{R_1} + \dfrac{1}{R_2} + ...</p>

## Potential dividers
Any circuit that contains more than one component can be described as a potential divider circuit. In its simplest form, a potential divider is 2 resistors connected across a power supply. If another component is placed in parallel with a section of the potential divider circuit, the operating potential difference of this component can be controlled.

The potential difference across each resistor is in proportion to the resistance in the circuit. This can be calculated using the following equations:

<p>\dfrac{V_1}{V_2} = \dfrac{R_1}{R_2}</p>

<p>V_2 = \Big(\dfrac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}\Big) V_s</p>

## Wheatstone bridges
Alternatively, two potential dividers can be connected in parallel. A voltmeter is connected between the two dividers. Resistors can be chosen such that there is different electrical potential at point A and B. This potential difference can be controlled by altering the resistors. If there is no potential difference between points A and B, the bridge is said to be balanced.
