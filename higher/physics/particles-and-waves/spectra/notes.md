## Irradiance

When radiation is incident on a surface, we can measure the irradiance. This is the power of the radiation per unit area of the surface, as seen in the following equation:

$$I = \dfrac{P}{A}$$

The unit for irradiance is $Wm^2$.

A point source of light is one which emits light evenly in all directions. The light spreads out as a sphere, with the light source at its centre. There is a relationship between irradiance and the distance from the point source of light. This is called the inverse square law and is given by the equation:

$$I = \dfrac{k}{d^2}$$

To solve some problems which compare irradiance of the same source from different distances, it can be easier to rearrange this equation into:

$$I_1d_1^2 = I_2d_2^2$$

## Laser beams

Because a laser beam is parallel, it does not behave like a point source and as such its irradiance does not decrease with distance according to the inverse square law. It therefore manages to maintain a very high irradiance at a single point, even at long distances. This is what gives lasers their power to be used in applications such as metal cutting and why they can be so dangerous if shone into someone’s eye.

## The Bohr model

In this model of the atom, the electrons orbit the nucleus at fixed distances. Each distance is known as an energy level, where electrons have a fixed energy value. Electrons can move from one energy level to another, but cannot stop in between. Electrons require energy to move to higher energy levels, further away from the nucleus. The closer an electron is to the nucleus, the more energy is required to raise it to a higher energy level. This is represented as electrons in lower energy levels, closer to the nucleus, having larger negative energy values.

## Electron transitions

A hydrogen atom has only one electron, but this electron can occupy any one of the atom’s energy levels. The energy level closest to the nucleus is called the ground level, labelled $E_0$. An electron in this energy level is said to be in its ground state.

The energy levels further from the nucleus, labelled $E_1$, $E_2$, $E_3$, etc. are called excited energy levels. An electron in any of these energy levels is said to be in an excited state.

If an electron gains enough energy to reach a level in the atom where it can escape the atom entirely then we say the electron has reached the ionisation level, where it has zero potential energy. When this happens, the atom is said to be in an ionisation state.

## Atomic spectra

When light is passed through a prism, diffraction grating or spectroscope, an atomic spectrum is produced. Different atoms produce different atomic spectra. As a result, an atom can be identified by observing its spectrum.

There are three main types of spectra:

- Line spectra
- Continuous spectra
- Absorption spectra

## Line spectra

Line spectra, or ‘emission line spectra’, are formed by an electron in an excited energy level of an atom making a transition to a lower energy level in the same atom. This process is spontaneous and can happen at any time. When an electron makes such a transition, one packet of electromagnetic energy is emitted from the atom in the form of a photon. The energy of this photon is exactly equal to the difference in energy between the two energy levels involved. This is shown in the equation:

$$hf = E_2 - E_1$$

The emitted photon often has a frequency within the visible spectrum, so produces a coloured emission line in the atom's emission line spectrum. However, photons with frequencies outside the visible spectrum are also possible. Each element has a different arrangement of energy levels and hence will emit photons of different frequencies to produce unique spectra.

## Continuous spectra

A tungsten filament lamp emits white light. When the white light is passed through a spectroscope, a continuous spectrum is obtained. This contains all colours of the visible spectrum with no gaps.

## Absorption spectra

When white light is passed through atoms of an element such as sodium in a gaseous state, the gaseous atoms absorb photons from the white light of specific frequencies. This produces a spectrum that contains all of the visible spectrum like the continuous spectra but with gaps where certain colours of visible light have been absorbed and not gotten through.

Similar to line spectra, atoms can only absorb photons if the energy carried by the photon is greater than or equal to the energy required to move an electron to a higher energy level. This is also unique to each element and different substances will produce different spectra. The lines missing in an absorption spectrum for a particular element will be the same as the lines that appear when testing the same element using line spectra.
