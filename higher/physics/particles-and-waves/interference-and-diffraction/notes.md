## Electromagnetic waves
Electromagnetic waves consist of a disturbance in the form of varying electric and magnetic fields. These waves carry energy from one place to another and can travel through a vacuum with a velocity of 3x10<sup>8</sup>ms<sup>-1</sup>.

## Interference
When two waves meet they superimpose on each other. This means they combine in such a way that their amplitudes are added together. This process is called interference. There are two types of interference:
 
- Constructive interference <br>
  When two wave crests or two wave troughs arrive at the same point at the same time, they are said to be in phase. The superposition of these two waves results in a stronger signal.
 
- Destructive interference <br>
  When a wave crest and a wave trough arrive at the same point at the same time, they are said to be out of phase. The superposition of these two waves causes the signals to cancel each other out.

## Maxima and minima
When interference occurs, it creates a pattern of points where the waves are perfectly in phase and out of phase.

- The points of maximum disturbance where the waves are completely in phase and constructive interference occurs are called ‘maxima’.

- The points of minimum disturbance where the waves are completely out of phase and destructive interference occurs are called ‘minima’.

Two waves are said to be coherent if they have the same frequency, wavelength and velocity and have a constant phase relationship. In order to achieve this, a single source must be used to produce the two waves. This can result in a regular interference pattern being produced.

## Path difference
The maxima in an interference pattern are all numbered from the strongest in the middle, m = 0, outwards in each direction. To reach the central maximum, waves from both sources have to travel the same distance from each source. To reach other maxima or minima, waves from the two sources have to travel different distances. The difference between these two distances is known as the ‘path difference’.

The path difference of each maxima is expressed as:

$$pd = m \lambda$$

The path difference of each minima is expressed as:

$$pd = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$

## Diffraction gratings
To produce a bright and sharp interference pattern for light, a diffraction grating can be used. This consists of many equally-spaced slits placed extremely close together. Light is diffracted through each slit, causing constructive and destructive interference. Monochromatic light (light of a single colour, and hence one frequency/wavelength) or white light can be used in experiments to provide the most accurate results.

By looking at two waves leaving the grating it can be shown that the path difference is d sin theta, where d is the distance between the slits on the diffraction grating. This gives us the diffraction grating formulae for constructive and destructive interference:

$$d sin \theta = m \lambda$$

$$d sin \theta = (m + \frac{1}{2})\lambda$$

Where:
- m = order of maxima / minima
- λ = wavelength of light (m) 
- d = distance between slits on diffraction grating (m)
- θ = angle between central maximum and maximum of order m

## Calculating distance
Using some trigonometry, we can rearrange the equations above to find the distance either from the source to the central maxima or between 2 maxima points.

$$sinθ = \dfrac{x}{D}$$

This can then be substituated in to give:

$$D = \dfrac{xd}{mλ}$$

$$x = \dfrac{Dmλ}{d}$$

## Visible light
As part of this course, you are expected to know the approximate wavelength values for blue, green and red light:
- Blue light:	4.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>m 	=   450 nm
- Green light:	5.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>m 	=   550 nm
- Red light:	6.5 x 10<sup>-7</sup>m 	=   650 nm
