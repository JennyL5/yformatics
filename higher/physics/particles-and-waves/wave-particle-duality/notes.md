## Classical vs Quantum
Classical wave theory states that electromagnetic energy, such as visible light, behaves as a continuous wave. In the early years of the 20th century, scientists Max Planck and Albert Einstein proposed an alternative theory for electromagnetic energy - the quantum theory:

> *“Electromagnetic energy is a stream of tiny, individual wave packets called quanta or photons.”*

As with classical wave theory, each photon has a velocity of 3x10<sup>8</sup>ms<sup>-1</sup> in air, and a frequency and wavelength related by the equation:

<p>v = f \lambda</p>

## Energy of a photon
The energy of a photon is directly proportional to its frequency when multiplied by a constant known as Planck's constant, with the value 6.63x10<sup>-34</sup>. This leads to the equation:

<p>E = hf</p>

With classical wave theory, the brighter a light source the more energy was carried, as shown in the amplitude of a wave graph. However, each photon only carries a set amount of energy. Higher total energy emitted from a source is accounted for by a higher total number of photons per second.

## Photoelectric effect
If one photon of electromagnetic energy strikes a metal surface, it can cause one electron to be ejected if the photon's energy is equal to or greater than the work function of the metal. Part of the photon's energy is being used to enable the electron to escape, the rest of the photon's energy is given to the emitted electron as kinetic energy. The photon then no longer exists. This process is known as the photoelectric effect, and the emission of the electron is known as photoelectric emission or photoemission.
The electrons in a metal are held in place by attractive forces. If an electron is to escape from the metal surface, it must overcome these attractive forces. The work function of a metal is the minimum energy which must be supplied to enable an electron to escape from the metal surface. It is defined by the equation:

<p>E = hf_0</p>

A photon must have a minimum energy equal to the work function of a metal, and hence a minimum frequency, to release an electron from the metal surface. This minimum frequency is called the threshold frequency and each metal has its own unique value.

## Photoelectric equation
Photoelectric emission is described by Einstein's photoelectric equation:

<p>Hf = hf_0 + E_k</p>

Where hf is the energy of an incident photon, hf<sub>0</sub> is the work function of the metal and E<sub>k</sub> is the kinetic energy given to an emitted electron. This is often rearranged to find the kinetic energy, which can also tell us if an electron is emitted at all:

Where hf is the energy of an incident photon, hf<sub>0</sub> is the work function of the metal and Ek is the kinetic energy given to an emitted electron. This is often rearranged to find the kinetic energy, which can also tell us if an electron is emitted at all:

<p>Ek = hf - hf_0</p>
