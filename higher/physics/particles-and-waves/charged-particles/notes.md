## Electric fields
An electric field is a region in which a charged particle will experience a force. If the particle is free to move then it will accelerate in the direction of the unbalanced force.
 
To represent an electric field in diagrams, we draw electric field lines. The arrows on the lines show the motion of a positive charge.

Work is done when a charge moves through an electric field. To move an electron towards a negatively charged plate, energy is needed. The work done is gained by the electron as electrical potential energy.
 
If the electron is free to move back towards the positively charged plate, the electric field does work on the electron. The electron’s electrical potential energy is changed to kinetic energy as the electric field accelerates the electron towards the positively charged plate.

## Potential difference
Potential difference is defined as the energy required to move one coulomb of charge between to points in an electric field.
 
This leads us to the equation for the total work done in moving charges in an electric field:

<p>E_w = QV</p>
 
One volt is the potential difference between two points when the energy required to move one coulomb of charge between them is one joule. One volt is therefore equivalent to one joule per coulomb.

<!--<p>V = JC^{-1}</p>-->
 
## Speed of charged particles
As we’ve seen, when a charged particle is free to move in the electric field between two oppositely charged metal plates, the work done by the electric field on the particle is converted to kinetic energy of the electron as it accelerates through the field. From this we can deduce:

<p>E_w = E_k</p>

<p>QV = \dfrac{1}{2} mv^2</p>

<p>v = \sqrt{ \dfrac{2QV}{m} }</p>
 
This allows the speed of the charged particle to after it has passed through the electric field to be calculated. Remember, if the charged particle enters the field with an initial speed then its initial kinetic energy must be added to the kinetic energy gained in the field before attempting to calculate its final velocity.

## Magnetic fields
Magnetic fields are created by moving charged particles, such as a current in a wire.
 
In a simple bar magnet, the magnetic field is generated by electrons orbiting atoms that make up the structure of the magnet. These atoms and their orbiting electrons are permanently lined up the same way producing a constant magnetic field around it, called a permanent magnet.
 
Temporary magnets are created by generating a flow of charged particles. This is how electromagnets work, giving us more control over the magnetic field in real-world applications.
 
## Left hand rule
If a current flows through a piece of wire then a magnetic field will be produced around the wire. The direction of the magnetic field depends on the direction of current flow. This can be modeled by clenching your left fist and pointing your thumb upwards. In this example, if the current is flowing through the wire in the direction of your thumb then the magnetic field will rotate in the direction of all your fingers. Equally, if the current is flowing the opposite direction, simply flip your left hand around the other way.

## Right hand rule
A wire carrying an electric current will experience a force when placed in a magnetic field. The magnitude of this force is directly proportional to the intensity of the current, the strength of the magnetic field and the length of the wire in the field. You can see this relationship by using the 'right hand rule' for electron current. If the first finger of your right hand points in the direction of the magnetic field, your middle finger in the direction of the current, then your thumb represents the direction of the force.

## Particle accelerators
Beams of charged particles experience a deflection by both electric and magnetic fields. This can be used to accelerate particles, cause collisions and investigate the particles and energies produced.

There are 3 main types of particle accelerator:

- Cyclotron <br>
  In a cyclotron, ions are injected at a point near the centre. An alternating potential difference between the ‘dee’ shaped electrodes accelerates the particles. A magnetic field causes the particles to move in a circular path. When the particle crosses from one dee to another it accelerates. After each acceleration, the particle moves to a slightly larger orbit. When it reaches the outer edge of the cyclotron the particle beam is extracted and used in other experiments. 

- Linear accelerator <br>
  Charged particles are accelerated in a vacuum pipe through a series of electrodes by an alternating voltage. The beam of particles is then directed at a target or into a synchrotron.

- Synchrotron <br>
  This is similar to a linear accelerator, bent into a ring so the charged particles can be given more energy each time they go round. Electromagnets keep the particles in a curved path. As the speed increases, the magnetic field strength is increased. As the speed increases and relativistic effect cause the mass of the particles to increase, a larger force is needed to accelerate them and keep them in a circular path.
