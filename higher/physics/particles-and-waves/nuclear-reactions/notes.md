## Nuclide notation
When referring to elements in nuclear equations, it makes it much easier to use nuclide notation. This involves writing the element symbol with its mass number and atomic number as shown in this example:

$${}^{235}_{92}U$$

The number on top (235 in the example) is the mass number, which represents the total number of protons and neutrons in the nucleus. The number on the bottom (92 in the example) is the atomic number, which represents the number of protons in the nucleus. 

## Alpha decay
Alpha decay takes place when an alpha particle, consisting of 2 protons and 2 neutrons, is ejected from an atom's nucleus. The nuclide notation for an alpha particle is the same as a Helium atom:

$${}^{4}_{2}He$$

When an atom goes through alpha decay, a new element is formed:

$${}^{238}_{92}U \rightarrow {}^{234}_{90}Th + {}^{4}_{2}He$$

The mass number of the new atom is 4 less than the original and the new atomic number is 2 less than the original. You can use a periodic table to work out which element the new atom is by looking at its atomic number.

## Beta Decay
Beta decay can occur in unstable nuclei where the nucleus emits an electron, leaving the atom with the same mass number but an increase of 1 in the atomic number.
For example:

$${}^{234}_{91}Pa \rightarrow {}^{234}_{92}U + {}^{0}_{-1}e$$
 
In general terms, we can think of this as a neutron becoming a proton:

$${}^{1}_{0}n \rightarrow {}^{1}_{1}p + {}^{0}_{-1}e$$
 
While the mass number and the charge of the atom are conserved, the actual mass of the proton is less than the mass of the neutron. This decrease in mass results in a release of energy, available as kinetic energy to the emitted electron.

## Gamma decay
Gamma rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation, not particles. When gamma rays are ejected from an atom's nucleus, it does not change the mass number or the atomic number of the atom. However, it does affect the energy state of the nucleus.

## Nuclear fission
In nuclear fission, a large atomic nucleus splits into 2 smaller nuclei and emits several neutrons. The smaller nuclei and neutrons that are produced gain very large amounts of kinetic energy.
 
This process can happen one of two ways:
- Spontaneous: <br>
  The large atomic nucleus becomes too unstable and splits by itself at random, there is no "outside influence".
 
- Induced by neutron bombardment: <br>
  A neutron is "fired" at a large nucleus, forcing it to split.
 
This is harnessed in nuclear power generation where Uranium 235 is bombarded by neutrons, causing it to split into smaller atoms and more neutrons while releasing a huge amount of energy.

## Nuclear fusion
In nuclear fusion, 2 small atomic nuclei combine to form an atom with a larger nucleus. Other small particles, such as neutrons, may also be left over. Like fission, the new particles produced gain a large amount of kinetic energy.
 
Nuclear fusion takes place in stars, like the sun. Extremely high initial temperatures are required for this fusion reaction to occur. At these temperatures, the reactant molecules lose their electrons and become positively charged ions. We refer to this as plasma.

## Lost mass
In both nuclear fission and nuclear fusion reactions, the mass of the products formed is always less than the mass of the starting species. This “lost mass” is converted into the kinetic energy that is given to the products and this can be seen in Einstein’s famous equation:

$$E=mc^2$$

## Containment issues
In nuclear fission reactors, the cooling system involves the thermal energy produced by the fission reaction being transferred away from the reactor into a conventional steam generator/turbine combination to generate electricity. The reactor itself is housed in a containment vessel consisting of concrete or lead to prevent the escape of radioactive material and nuclear radiation.
 
In nuclear fusion reactors, the extremely high temperatures of the plasma required for fusion to occur mean a normal material containment vessel would not be suitable. The walls would melt or evaporate. Therefore, a strong magnetic field is used to contain the plasma that is made from positively charged ions.
