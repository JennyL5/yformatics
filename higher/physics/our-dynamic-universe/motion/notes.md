## Kinematics Revision

Kinematics is the study of the motions of objects. When we are looking at the forces that cause this motion, we are studying dynamics. At national 5, you should have used the following equations:

$$d = vt$$

$$s = vt$$

These are almost identical but with the key difference of calculating scalars or vectors.

- A scalar quantity only has a magnitude.
- A vector quantity has a magnitude and a direction.

## Equations of Motion

There are four equations of motion that can be applied to any object moving with uniform acceleration in a straight line:

$$v = u + at$$

$$v^2 = u^2 + 2as$$

$$s = ut + \dfrac{1}{2} at^2$$

$$s = \dfrac{1}{2} (u + v)t$$

where:

- s = displacement ($m$)
- u = initial velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
- v = final velocity ($ms^{-1}$)
- a = acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)
- t = time ($s$)

As a general rule in physics, we think of to the right or upwards as a positive direction, and to the left or downwards as a negative direction for vector values. If no direction is specified for the accelerating object, we assume it is travelling to the right.

## Vertical movement

Any object moving freely through the air is accelerated towards the ground under the influence of gravity regardless of if the object is falling or moving upwards. Gravity always provides a downward acceleration of $9.8ms^{-2}$. If we adopt the sign convention where up is positive, we must use the value of $-9.8ms^{-2}$ for the downward acceleration of an object moving freely through the air.

## Motion-time graphs

There are 3 main types of motion-time graphs:

- Displacement-time graphs
- Velocity-time graphs
- Acceleration-time graphs

If you have an example of one of these types of graph, then it is possible to draw the other two corresponding graphs via differentiation or integration. If the function for a displacement-time graph is $f(x)$, then a velocity-time graph would be $f'(x)$ and an acceleration-time graph would be $f''(x)$.
