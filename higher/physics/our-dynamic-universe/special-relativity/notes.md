## Introduction
All motion is relative within a frame of reference. Previously, Newton had suggested there was an absolute frame of reference called the ‘ether’ which all motion could be measured against. Einstein’s theory of special relativity, however, explains how there is no such thing and instead we interpret motion between different inertial frames of reference. Inertial frames of reference are simply two places that are moving at constant velocities relative to one another. Special relativity refers to this case where the relative motion is uniform, where the objects have a constant speed in a straight line.

Both Newton and Galileo developed a concept suggesting that laws in Physics are true whether moving at a constant velocity or at rest. This is called ‘Galilean invariance’.

The postulates on which Einstein based his theory of Special Relativity are:
- The speed of light is a constant value in every frame of reference <br>
  No matter what speed you are travelling at, the speed of light in a vacuum is 3x10<sup>8</sup>ms<sup>-1</sup>.
- Galilean invariance holds true for all frames of reference <br>
  There is no experiment you can do to tell if you are moving at a constant velocity or at rest.

As a consequence of Einstein’s theories, measured time and length will change for a moving system depending who is observing the system. The speed of light cannot change so the time and the distances must change.

## Time Dilation
If you move fast enough through space, the observations you make about space and time will differ from the observations of other people who are moving at different speeds.

To prove this, Einstein came up with a thought experiment: <br>
This involves a ‘light clock’ which is simply two mirrors with a light beam reflecting between them. The clock measures the time taken for the beam to travel between the mirrors. If this light clock is moving horizontally then an observer in the same frame of reference as the clock would discern no difference. They would observe the light reflecting in a straight vertical line. A stationary observer, however, would see the light beam moving diagonally as a result of the relative motion.

This apparent greater distance is the vector combination of the mirror displacement and the mirror separation, which gives rise to the equation:

$$t' = \dfrac{t}{\sqrt{1 - \Big(\dfrac{v}{c}\Big)^2}}$$

Where:
- $t' =$ time observed by a stationary observer ($s$)
- $t =$ time observed by a moving ovserver ($s$)
- $v =$ velocity of the object ($ms^{-1}$)
- $c =$ the speed of light ($ms^{-1}$)

## Length Contraction
Another implication of Einstein’s theory is the observed decrease in the length of an object which is moving at high speeds. This is called length contraction and is only noticeable at a substantial fraction of the speed of light, and only in the direction parallel to the direction in which the observed body is travelling.

$$l' = l\sqrt{1 - \Big(\dfrac{v}{c}\Big)^2}$$

Where:
- $l' =$ observed length by a stationary observer ($m$)
- $l =$ observed length by a moving observer ($m$)
- $v =$ velocity of the object ($ms^{-1}$)
- $c =$ the speed of light ($ms^{-1}$)

## Lorentz Factor
This is the scaling factor which shows the increase in time or decrease in length measured by a stationary observer compared to that by the observer in the moving frame.

It can also be expressed as:

$$t' = \gamma t$$

where:

$$\gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \Big(\dfrac{v}{c}\Big)^2}}$$
