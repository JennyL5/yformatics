## Metalic bonding

Metalic bonding, as the name suggests, occurs between metal elements. This is similar to ionic bonding in that each atom loses electrons. However, rather than another atom gaining those electrons, they are delocalised in a 'sea' surrounding the atoms, producing an electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the negative electrons. These delocalised electrons are the reason that metals are so good at conducting electricity.

## Covalent molecules

Covalent bonding is the electrostatic attraction between two positive neucli and a negative shared pair of electrons. Covalent molecules are normally made up of just a few atoms and they tend to have have low melting points and boiling points.

Hydrogen, Nitrogen, Oxygen, Flurine, Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine are all known as diatomic elements because they join up in covalently bonded pairs. When writing these elements in equations, when they are not in compounds, you should write them as a pair, for example Oxygen should be written as O<sub>2</sub>.

## Covalent networks

Certain elements can form multiple covalent bonds that then daisychain together to create massive structures. A single covalent network could contain anywhere from thousands to billions of atoms. The bonds in these these structures are so strong that they usually have extremely high melting and boiling points as it takes a lot of energy to break them apart. Some examples of covalent networks include dimond and graphite which are both made of carbon in differnt arrangements.

## Monatomic elements

Some elements, such as the group 8 nobel gases, already have 8 electrons in their outer shell. This means that they are not very likely to need electrons from other atoms and therefore do not bond easily. They simply exist as individual atoms.
