## Intermolecular Bonds
While intramolecular forces act between atoms to form differnt types of compounds, intermolecular bonds are the attractive forces that act between molecules to bind them together. There are three main types of these that each work in different ways and subsequently have different strengths. These bonds can each be broken by applying heat to the molecules, but some are far easier to break than others.

## London Dispersion Forces
The first type of intermolecular bond we look at is london dispersion forces, sometimes reffered to as Van der Waals forces. This is a temporary attractive force that results when the electrons in two adjacent atoms occupy positions that make the atoms form temporary dipoles.

## Perniment Dipoles
This type of intermolecular bond is stronger than london dispersion forces. Perniment dipoles occur when two adjacent atoms in a molecule have sufficient difference in electronegativity that electrons are pulled towards one of them. This gives one side of the molecule a slight positive charge and the other a slight negative charge. When the balance of charge in a molecule can be clearly divided into two sides, then that whole molecule is referred to as being polar.

## Hydrogen Bonding
The strongest type of intermolecular force is a hydrogen bond. Evidence for these can be seen in the unusually high boiling points of compounds that have a Hydrogen atom bonded to an Oxygen, Nitrogen or Fluorine atom. In these compounds the Hydrogen electron in each atom is strongly pulled towards the other element, causing a very strong positive charge at the end of each chain. An example of this in a substance can be seen below.
