## Applying heat
When making a meal, we often like to cook our food. This not only warms it up, but can actually make it taste better. Applying heat can cause a huge number of chemical and physical changes in compounds which can have a direct impact on flavour. However, it is not as simple as simply cooking food; the method which we choose can have major effects on the results.

## Chemical structures
Before we look at different cooking processes, it is important to understand the chemical structures that relate to different types of flavours. Below are the strctural diagrams of two compounds which are the molecules responsible for the smell of strawberries and vanilla respectively:

An important difference to notice here is

## Fat soluble molecules

## Water soluble molecules

## Enzymes

## Oxidation of food
