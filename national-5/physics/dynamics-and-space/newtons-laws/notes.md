## Balanced forces
When you stand on the ground there are two forces acting on you, gravity acting downwards and the ground pushing upwards. These two forces are exactly equal in magnitude and opposite in direction which causes them to cancel each other out. That's why you don't either create a massive hole through the earth or float away into space, your motion is said to be constant. Isaac Newton categorised this concept in his first law of motion:

> *“If the forces acting on an object are balanced, the object will continue to travel with constant speed in a straight line”*

Note that, as in the example above, a 'constant speed' can also mean at rest.

## Unbalanced forces
If you jump into the air then the force supplied by your muscles becomes greater than the force of gravity holding you down. This creates a resultant force that accelerates you upwards. Newton characterised this as an unbalanced force defined in his second law of motion:

> *“If the forces acting on an object are unbalanced, the object will experience an acceleration.”*

Along with the law, Newton also came up with an equation that can be used to calculate the unbalanced force: 

$$F = ma$$

Where:
- $F =$ force ($N$)
- $m =$ mass ($kg$)
- $a =$ acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)

## Reaction forces
If you try to push against a wall then you can feel the force of the wall pushing back. This is the concept that is covered by Newton's third law:

> *"For every action there is an equal and opposite reaction."*

These forces always come in pairs acting in opposite directions. You need to learn to look out for these pairs and be able to identify the reaction force when given the initial action.

## Gravity
The force of gravity has been mentioned a lot in this topic and there is an equation to calculate that too. It is refered to as 'weight' but is also measured in Newtons:

$$W = mg$$

Where:
- $W =$ weight ($N$)
- $m =$ mass ($kg$)
- $g =$ gravitational field strength ($Nkg^{-1}$)

The gravitational field strength on Earth is given as $9.8Nkg^{-1}$.

## Friction
When the surface of two materials touch, a force of friction is caused between them. The magnitude of the force is determined by the properties of the two materials and we can use this infomation to our advantage in real life. For example, car tires need to have a high level of friction with road surfaces in order to gain traction and not just slide around all day. Whereas when cooking, anti-stick frying pans allow us to cook without worrying about the food getting stuck to the pan.
