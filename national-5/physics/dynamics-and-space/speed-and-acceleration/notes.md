## Average & instantaneous
When measuring the speed of a travelling object, there are two differnt ways to define it:

- Average speed <br>
  This can be calculated by dividing the total distance in metres by the total time in seconds that the object takes to travel that distance. This gives an overall speed regardless of accelaration.

- Instantaneous speed <br>
  This is the speed of an object at any particular point while it is travelling. This will change if the object Accelerates or decelerates.

## Speed, distance & time
Each of the speed, distance and time of an object can be calculated if either of the other two are known. This is given be the equation:

$$d = vt$$

Where:
- $d =$ distance ($m$)
- $v =$ speed ($ms^{-1}$)
- $t =$ time ($s$)

You may also see ms<sup>-1</sup> written as m/s.

## Acceleration
This measures how quickly the speed of an object is changing. It can be calculated using the equation:

$$a = \dfrac{v-u}{t}$$

Where:
- $a =$ acceleration ($ms^{-2}$)
- $u =$ initial speed ($ms^{-1}$)
- $v =$ final speed ($ms^{-1}$)
- $t =$ time ($s$)
