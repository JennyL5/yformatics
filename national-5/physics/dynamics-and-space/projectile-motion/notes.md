## Directional forces

When a ball is thrown from one end of a field to the other, it will travel horizontally forward but it also travels vertically due to the forces applied to it. The path of the ball can be seen below.

For the first half of its journey, the ball travels vertically upwards from the force of the throw. For the second half, it then travels vertically downwards as gravity acts on it. Recognising the forces acting on objects in motion allows you to isolate the vertical and horizontal movement.
