## Conservation of energy

Energy can never be created or destroyed, only transered from one form to another. It can take many different forms incluing kinetic, gravitational potential, electrical, heat, light and chemical. Energy is a scalar quantity and is measured in joules ($J$).

## Work

When an unbalanced force is applied to an object to move it a certain distance, energy is exchanged. This is displayed in the equation:

$$E_w = Fd$$

Where:

- $E_w =$ work ($J$)
- $F =$ force ($N$)
- $d =$ distance ($m$)

## Power

Power is a way to measure the rate at which energy is converted between differnt forms. This is often given as the rate of work done. It is also a scalar quantity and is measured in watts ($W$).

$$P = \dfrac{E_w}{t}$$

Where:

- $P =$ power ($W$)
- $E_w =$ work ($J$)
- $t =$ time ($s$)

## Kinetic energy

This type of energy is held by masses in motion. The magnitude of energy gained by an object can be calculated using the following equation:

$$E_k = \dfrac{1}{2}mv^2$$

Where:

- $E_k =$ kinetic energy ($J$)
- $m =$ mass ($kg$)
- $v =$ velocity ($ms^{-1}$)

## Gravitational potential

This type of energy is held by masses that are vertically raised. The higher the object the more potential energy it gains. The magnitude of this energy can be calculated using the following equation:

$E_p = mgh$

Where:

- $E_p =$ gravitational potential energy ($J$)
- $m =$ mass ($kg$)
- $g =$ gravitational field strength ($Nkg^{-1}$)
- $h =$ height ($m$)

## Efficiency

Every time energy is intentionally converted from one form to another, some of the initial energy is accidentally converted into unwanted forms. This means that this energy is essentially wasted within the process. This can be expressed in input energy ($E_i$) and output energy ($E_o$). Efficiency is a measure of how well any given process can convert the $E_i$ into useful $E_o$:

$$\text{Percentage efficency} = \dfrac{\text{useful } E_o}{E_i} \times 100$$

This calculation doesn't have a unit to measure it in, it is simply a percentage.
