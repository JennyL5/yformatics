## Quantities
When measuring quantities in physics they tend to fall into two catagories:

- A scalar quanitity only has a magntude. <br>
  Some examples of scalar quantities include speed, time and mass.

- A vector quanitity has a magnitude and a direction. <br>
  Vector quantities are a little more complicated than scalars. Velocity is equivilent to speed but with a direction, as is displacement the distance of the straight line between the start and end points of a travelling object's path. Acceleration and force are also examples of vector quanitities.

## Line vectors
All vector quantities can be drawn by a straight line arrow that is pointed in the direction that the quanitity is acting. The length of the arrow represents the magnitude of the vector. When doing problems involving these, it can help to draw a free body diagram with the moving object and all the vectors involved. As long as the directions are all maintained, the actual arrows can be moved around into whichever position is easiest to work with.

## Adding vectors
Moving vetors around in a diagram can allow us to put them into a form where they can then be added together and combined. The calculation to do this will depend on the angles between the vectors you are trying to add.

For vectors which are parallel, if the arrows are pointed in the same direction then both of their magnitudes can simply be added. Alternatively, if the arrows are in opposite directions then one arrow should be defined as the positive direction and the other negative. Which one is which can differ between examples, but the genral rule is that either upwards or to the right are positive and either downwards or to the left are negative. If you are unsure of which one is which then you can decide for yourself as long as you state your choice clearly in your working.

For vectors that are perpendicular, you can work out differnt values depedning on what infomation you are given. If you have two vetor magnitudes then you should put them tip to tail and draw a line to complete the triangle. The magnitude of this 'resultant' vector can be calculated using Pythagoras' Theorem. If you are given an angle or are asked to find an angle then you can do this using trigonometry. Scale drawing is also a valid method but be weary of diagrams that are not to scale and always use a ruler.
