## Capitalisation
In German, all nouns start with a capital letter. There is not a different rule for proper nouns like there is in English.

<ul>
	<li style="color: #F44336;">Du bist ein <z>kind</z></li>
	<li style="color: #54ad59;">Du bist ein <z>Kind</z></li>
</ul>

## Gender
All nouns have a gender. There are three genders in German - masculine, feminine, and neuter. You can tell which gender a noun has by its definite article. In English, there is only one definite article - “the”. German has  three, one for each gender:

- Der Hund - masculine
- Die Katze - feminine
- Das Pferd - neuter

Unlike other languages like French or Spanish, it isn’t obvious what a German noun’s gender is just from looking at it. It’s really important to learn the gender of a noun when you learn the noun itself.

Be careful, the gender of a noun does not necessarily match the meaning of a noun. For example, Das Mädchen means “girl”, but it’s a neuter word, not feminine.
