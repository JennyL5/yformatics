## Power series

A power series is a series of the form:

$$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n x^n$$

Bare in mind that the above power series is centered at 0. You may be asked for the expansion of one centered at a different value, in which case you can use the form:

$$\displaystyle\sum\limits_{n=0}^{\infty} c_n (x - a)^n$$

Where the power series is centered at $a$.

<!-- A (power) series always converges at its center. -->
