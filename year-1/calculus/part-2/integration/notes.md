## How to integrate

In this topic, you will see more complex methods of calculating integrals which are far more complex, but at the most basic level integrals are calculated by:

$$\displaystyle\int x^n = \dfrac{x^{n+1}}{n+1} + c$$

The $c$ added at the end is further explained in the indefinite integrals section below.

## By substitution

For more complex integrals, it can often be helpful to substitute another easier value to integrate and then sub back at the end. This process has a few steps:

For the purposes of explanation, let's use the example:

$$\displaystyle\int x$$

1. pick a function of $x$ in your integral to substitute, and make it equal to $u$.

$$u = x$$

## By parts

It has been said that calculating integrals can become a lot like reading, with practice. In this case, you need to look out for cases where you need to find the integral of the product of a function of $x$ with it's derivative.

This can then be drawn to the following equivalency:

$$\displaystyle\int uv' = uv - \displaystyle\int u'v$$
