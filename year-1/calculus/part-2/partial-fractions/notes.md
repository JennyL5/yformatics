## Introduction

Often you may come across questions that ask you to find the integral of complex equations. Some of these can be polynomials in the form:

$$\dfrac{P(x)}{Q(x)}$$

When faced with this, attempting the equation as it is can take a really long time or even be beyond your current ability. However, there are ways we can simplify it into manageable parts in order to complete the question far more easily.

## Algebraic long division

Before we look at splitting up any fractions, we need to ensure it is in its simplest form. If the degree of the numerator is higher than that of the denominator, we need to use algebraic long division. This is very similar to numeric long division but can have a few more steps.

To see this in action, let's use the example:

$$\dfrac{x^2 + 12}{x - 2}$$

## Types of functions

Once we have the function in its simplest form, we can now split it up into different parts. Now we need to look at its properties in order to work out how to do that. There are three main options:

- Product of linear factors <br>
  something written underneath

- Product of repeated linear factors

- Product of irreducible quadratic factors
