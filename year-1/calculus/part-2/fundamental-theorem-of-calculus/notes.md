## Introduction

Although so far we have looked at differentiation and integration and some useful theorems to tackle problems, we have not dug into the guts of what is at the core of calculus. Here, we find a set of theorems that define the ground rules that the rest is built on.

The following will be laid out randomly until we find a good structure to put it in.

1.

Suppose a continuous function $f(x) \neq 0 \forall x \in [a,b]$.

This implies that:

$$\displaystyle\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx \ne 0$$

Since $f$ is continuous and does not cross 0 we can see:

- if $f(x) \gt 0 \forall x \in [a,b]$ then $\displaystyle\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx \gt 0$.

- if $f(x) \lt 0 \forall x \in [a,b]$ then $\displaystyle\int_{a}^{b} f(x) dx \lt 0$.
