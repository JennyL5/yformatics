## Process

Although you may not have an intinctial idea for how to sketch complex fuctions, the process for doing it is actually quite formulatic.

1. Determine the domain of the function

2. Find the axis intercepts

3. Determine if there is any symmetry

4. Determine if there are any asymptotes

5. Determine the intervals over which the function is increasing & decreasing

6. Find any local maxima & minima

7. Determine the concavity of the points of infection

Once all of this information is found, sketching the graph is just a matter of putting it all together. Each of the steps are outlined in more detail below.
