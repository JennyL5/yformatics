## How to differentiate

In this topic, we will look at many different rules for how to integrate different types of functions. In general, we can define differentiation as the following opperation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= x^n \\\\
f'(x) &= nx^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Definition

The proof for differentiation is given by:

$$f'(x) = \dfrac{f(x)}{h}$$

This can be very useful in some cases, and there is guarenteed to be a question in the exam where you need to use this so it is worth learning.

## Chain rule

In a previous topic, we looked at composite functions. When you have a fuction that is the composite of two separate functions of $x$.

## Product rule

When you have a fuction that is the product of two separate functions of $x$.

## Quotient rule

When you have a fuction that is the division of two separate functions of $x$.
