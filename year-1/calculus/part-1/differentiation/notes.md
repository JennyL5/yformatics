## How to differentiate

In this topic, we will look at many different rules for how to integrate different types of functions. In general, we can define differentiation as the following operation.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= x^n \\\\
f'(x) &= nx^{n-1}
\end{aligned}
$$

## Definition

The definition of the derivative of a fuction $f$ is given by:

$$f'(x) = \displaystyle\lim_{h \to 0} \dfrac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$

This can be very useful and there is guaranteed to be a question in the exam where you need to use this so it is worth learning.

## Chain rule

In a previous topic, we looked at composite functions. When you have a function that is the composite of two separate functions of $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= f(g(x)) \\\\
f'(x) &= f'(g(x))g'(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Product rule

This is for when you need to differentiate a function that is the product of two separate functions of $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= f(x)g(x) \\\\
f'(x) &= f'(x)g(x) + f(x)g'(x)
\end{aligned}
$$

## Quotient rule

This is for when you need to differentiate a function that is the division of two separate functions of $x$.

$$
\begin{aligned}
f(x) &= \dfrac{f(x)}{g(x)} \\\\
\\\\
f'(x) &= \dfrac{f'(x)g(x) - f(x)g'(x)}{g(x)^2}
\end{aligned}
$$
