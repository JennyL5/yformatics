## Domains

The domain of a function $f$ is the bounds of the values of $x$ for which $f(x)$ is defined. This is most commonly applied when we have a rational function where, for some value of $x$, the denominator will be 0, making $f(x)$ undefined.

## Continuity

## Odd & even functions

Odd and even functions are mathematical catagories of functions, which relate a function to its symmetric properties.

Even functions can be proven by showing:

$$f(-x) = f(x)$$

Odd functions can be proven by showing:

$$f(-x) = -f(x)$$

The only function that is both odd and even is one that equates to 0.
